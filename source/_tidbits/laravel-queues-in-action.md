Lately, I read Mohamed Said's *Laravel Queues in Action* book. Mohamed has extensive knowledge of the queue system and is very trustworthy. His book is a must-read for every Laravel developer. I learned so many new things that I didn't know, and it helped me strengthen my knowledge of queues.

The book is packed with real-world examples, advice, and great explanations.

It is well worth the money.

You can get it [here](https://learn-laravel-queues.com/).
